File: whack_a_mole.py
-------------------
This is a program that puts random moles on the screen that the
user must click to "whack" and earn points.

Each iteration of the animation loop, there is a small chance that a mole appears somewhere
random on the screen.  If the user clicks a mole, the mole disappears and the user's score,
displayed in the upper-left corner in a label, increases by 1.
The game plays until the user gets a certain number of points.
